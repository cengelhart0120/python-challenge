# Module 3 (Python) Challenge Readme File

For the most part, the written Python codes were derived from curriculum content, via instruction and/or in-class activities, but there were some sources consulted for completing each challenge (all are also mentioned within each code).
    
The first mentioned source was found at:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/664294/is-it-possible-only-to-declare-a-variable-without-assigning-any-value-in-python
For the way I tackled both analyses, I thought it would be helpful to set so-called "empty" variables, so had to confirm this was possible, as well as how to do it.

The second mentioned source was found at:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14515274/how-to-check-if-a-string-is-in-a-list-of-strings
The information I saw here was useful because it allowed for a quick check of whether a string was within a list of strings.

The third mentioned source was found at:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5982206/how-to-print-a-linebreak-in-a-python-function
It allowed me to add line breaks to the output; I don't recall covering this in this way in class.

The last mentioned source was found at:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29223246/how-do-i-save-data-in-a-text-file-python
This was useful because it provided guidance for outputting text to a .txt file. I only recall covering how to output a .csv file in the course materials.

For more in-depth rationale for specific code/lines of code, please see the code files themselves because they contain comments throughout.
